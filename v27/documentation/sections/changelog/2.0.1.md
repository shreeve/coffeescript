*   `babel-core` is no longer listed in `package.json`, even as an `optionalDependency`, to avoid it being automatically installed for most users. If you wish to use `--transpile`, simply install `babel-core` manually. See [Transpilation](#transpilation).
*   `--transpile` now relies on Babel to find its options, i.e. the `.babelrc` file in the path of the file(s) being compiled. (Previously the CoffeeScript compiler was duplicating this logic, so nothing has changed from a userâ€™s perspective.) This provides automatic support for additional ways to pass options to Babel in future versions, such as the `.babelrc.js` file coming in Babel 7.
*   Backticked expressions in a class body, outside any class methods, are now output in the JavaScript class body itself. This allows for passing through experimental JavaScript syntax like the [class fields proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields), assuming your [transpiler supports it](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/).
