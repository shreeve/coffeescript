CoffeeScript now has a syntax for defining classes. Many of the core components (Nodes, Lexer, Rewriter, Scope, Optparse) are using them. Cakefiles can use `optparse.coffee` to define options for tasks. `--run` is now the default flag for the `coffee` command, use `--compile` to save JavaScripts. Bugfix for an ambiguity between RegExp literals and chained divisions.
