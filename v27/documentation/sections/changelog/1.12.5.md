*   Better handling of `default`, `from`, `as` and `*` within `import` and `export` statements. You can now import or export a member named `default` and the compiler won’t interpret it as the `default` keyword.
*   Fixed a bug where invalid octal escape sequences weren’t throwing errors in the compiler.
