```

*   The `--join` option of the CLI is now deprecated.
*   Source maps now use `.js.map` as file extension, instead of just `.map`.
*   The CLI now exits with the exit code 1 when it fails to write a file to disk.
*   The compiler no longer crashes on unterminated, single-quoted strings.
*   Fixed location data for string interpolations, which made source maps out of sync.
*   The error marker in error messages is now correctly positioned if the code is indented with tabs.
*   Fixed a slight formatting error in CoffeeScriptâ€™s source map-patched stack traces.
*   The `%%` operator now coerces its right operand only once.
*   It is now possible to require CoffeeScript files from Cakefiles without having to register the compiler first.
*   The CoffeeScript REPL is now exported and can be required using `require 'coffeescript/repl'`.
*   Fixes for the REPL in Node 0.11.
