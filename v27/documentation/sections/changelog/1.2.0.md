```

*   Multiple improvements to `coffee --watch` and `--join`. You may now use both together, as well as add and remove files and directories within a `--watch`â€™d folder.
*   The `throw` statement can now be used as part of an expression.
*   Block comments at the top of the file will now appear outside of the safety closure wrapper.
*   Fixed a number of minor 1.1.3 regressions having to do with trailing operators and unfinished lines, and a more major 1.1.3 regression that caused bound functions _within_ bound class functions to have the incorrect `this`.
