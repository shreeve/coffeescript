```

Official CoffeeScript variable style is now camelCase, as in JavaScript. Reserved words are now allowed as object keys, and will be quoted for you. Range comprehensions now generate cleaner code, but you have to specify `by -1` if youâ€™d like to iterate downward. Reporting of syntax errors is greatly improved from the previous release. Running `coffee` with no arguments now launches the REPL, with Readline support. The `<-` bind operator has been removed from CoffeeScript. The `loop` keyword was added, which is equivalent to a `while true` loop. Comprehensions that contain closures will now close over their variables, like the semantics of a `forEach`. You can now use bound function in class definitions (bound to the instance). For consistency, `a in b` is now an array presence check, and `a of b` is an object-key check. Comments are no longer passed through to the generated JavaScript.
