CoffeeScript 0.3 includes major syntax changes:
The function symbol was changed to `->`, and the bound function symbol is now `=>`.
Parameter lists in function definitions must now be wrapped in parentheses.
Added property soaking, with the `?.` operator.
Made parentheses optional, when invoking functions with arguments.
Removed the obsolete block literal syntax.
