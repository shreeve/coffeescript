CoffeeScript now uses appropriately-named temporary variables, and recycles their references after use. Added `require.extensions` support for **Node.js 0.3**. Loading CoffeeScript in the browser now adds just a single `CoffeeScript` object to global scope. Fixes for implicit object and block comment edge cases.
