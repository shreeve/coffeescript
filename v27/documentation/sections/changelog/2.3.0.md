```

*   This release adds support for all the new features and syntaxes in ES2018 that werenâ€™t already possible in CoffeeScript. For all of the below features, make sure that you [transpile](#transpilation) unless you know that your target runtime(s) support each feature.
*   Asynchronous iterators are now supported. You can now `yield` an `await` call, e.g. `do -> until file.EOF then yield await file.readLine()`.
*   Object splats/destructuring, a.k.a. object rest/spread syntax, has been standardized as part of ES2018 and therefore this release removes the polyfill that had previously been supporting this syntax. Code like `{a, b, rest...} = obj` now outputs more or less just like it appears, rather than being converted into an `Object.assign` call. Note that there are [some subtle differences](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/object-rest-spread) between the `Object.assign` polyfill and the native implementation.
*   The exponentiation operator, `**`, and exponentiation assignment operator `**=` are new to JavaScript in ES2018. Now code like `a ** 3` is output as it appears, rather than being converted into `Math.pow(a, 3)` as it was before.
*   The `s` (dotAll) flag is now supported in regular expressions.
