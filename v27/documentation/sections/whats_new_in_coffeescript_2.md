### Whatâ€™s New In CoffeeScript 2?

The biggest change in CoffeeScript 2 is that now the CoffeeScript compiler produces modern JavaScript syntax (ES6, or ES2015 and later). A CoffeeScript `=>` becomes a JS `=>`, a CoffeeScript `class` becomes a JS `class` and so on. Major new features in CoffeeScript 2 include [async functions](#async-functions) and [JSX](#jsx). You can read more in the [announcement](announcing-coffeescript-2/).

There are very few [breaking changes from CoffeeScript 1.x to 2](#breaking-changes); we hope the upgrade process is smooth for most projects.
