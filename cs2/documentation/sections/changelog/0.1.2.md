Fixed a bug with calling `super()` through more than one level of inheritance, with the re-addition of the `extends` keyword. Added experimental [Narwhal](http://narwhaljs.org/) support (as a Tusk package), contributed by [Tom Robinson](http://blog.tlrobinson.net/), including **bin/cs** as a CoffeeScript REPL and interpreter. New `--no-wrap` option to suppress the safety function wrapper.
