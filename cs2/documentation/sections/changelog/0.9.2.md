Specifying the start and end of a range literal is now optional, eg. `array[3..]`. You can now say `a not instanceof b`. Fixed important bugs with nested significant and non-significant indentation (Issue #637). Added a `--require` flag that allows you to hook into the `coffee` command. Added a custom `jsl.conf` file for our preferred JavaScriptLint setup. Sped up Jison grammar compilation time by flattening rules for operations. Block comments can now be used with JavaScript-minifier-friendly syntax. Added JavaScriptâ€™s compound assignment bitwise operators. Bugfixes to implicit object literals with leading number and string keys, as the subject of implicit calls, and as part of compound assignment.
