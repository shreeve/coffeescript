```

*   Source maps have been used to provide automatic line-mapping when running CoffeeScript directly via the `coffee` command, and for automatic line-mapping when running CoffeeScript directly in the browser. Also, to provide better error messages for semantic errors thrown by the compiler â€” [with colors, even](http://cl.ly/NdOA).
*   Improved support for mixed literate/vanilla-style CoffeeScript projects, and generating source maps for both at the same time.
*   Fixes for **1.6.x** regressions with overriding inherited bound functions, and for Windows file path management.
*   The `coffee` command can now correctly `fork()` both `.coffee` and `.js` files. (Requires Node.js 0.9+)
