Fixed a lexer bug with Unicode identifiers. Updated REPL for compatibility with Node.js 0.3.7\. Fixed requiring relative paths in the REPL. Trailing `return` and `return undefined` are now optimized away. Stopped requiring the core Node.js `util` module for back-compatibility with Node.js 0.2.5\. Fixed a case where a conditional `return` would cause fallthrough in a `switch` statement. Optimized empty objects in destructuring assignment.
