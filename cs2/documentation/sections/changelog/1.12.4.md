*   The `cake` commands have been updated, with new `watch` options for most tasks. Clone the [CoffeeScript repo](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript) and run `cake` at the root of the repo to see the options.
*   Fixed a bug where `export`ing a referenced variable was preventing the variable from being declared.
*   Fixed a bug where the `coffee` command wasnâ€™t working for a `.litcoffee` file.
*   Bugfixes related to tokens and location data, for better source maps and improved compatibility with downstream tools.
