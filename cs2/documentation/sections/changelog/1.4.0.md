*   The CoffeeScript compiler now strips Microsoftâ€™s UTF-8 BOM if it exists, allowing you to compile BOM-borked source files.
*   Fix Node/compiler deprecation warnings by removing `registerExtension`, and moving from `path.exists` to `fs.exists`.
*   Small tweaks to splat compilation, backticks, slicing, and the error for duplicate keys in object literals.
