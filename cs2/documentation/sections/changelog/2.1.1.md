*   Bugfix to set the correct context for executable class bodies. So in `class @B extends @A then @property = 1`, the `@` in `@property` now refers to the class, not the global object.
*   Bugfix where anonymous classes were getting created using the same automatic variable name. They now each receive unique names, so as not to override each other.
