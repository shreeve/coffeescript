*   CoffeeScript now supports ES2015 generators. A generator is simply a function that `yield`s.
*   More robust parsing and improved error messages for strings and regexes â€” especially with respect to interpolation.
*   Changed strategy for the generation of internal compiler variable names. Note that this means that `@example` function parameters are no longer available as naked `example` variables within the function body.
*   Fixed REPL compatibility with latest versions of Node and Io.js.
*   Various minor bug fixes.
