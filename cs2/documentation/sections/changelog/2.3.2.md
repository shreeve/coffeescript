*   Babel 7 is now supported. With version 7, the Babel team moved from `babel-core` on NPM to `@babel/core`. Now the CoffeeScript `--transpile` option will first search for `@babel/core` (Babel versions 7 and above) and then search for `babel-core` (versions 6 and below) to try to find an installed version of Babel to use for transpilation.
*   The syntax [`new.target`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new.target) is now supported.
*   You can now follow the keyword `yield` with an indented object, like has already been allowed for `return` and other keywords.
*   Previously, any comments inside a JSX tag or attribute would cause interpolation braces (`{` and `}`) to be output. This is only necessary for line (`#`, or `//` in JavaScript) comments, not here (`###`, or `/* */`) comments; so now the compiler checks if all the comments that would trigger the braces are here comments, and if so it doesnâ€™t generate the unnecessary interpolation braces.
