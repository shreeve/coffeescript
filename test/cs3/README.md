# CS3 Test Suite

This directory contains the complete test suite for CoffeeScript 3 (CS3) with the Solar parser and ES5 backend.

## Status: 100% Pass Rate ✅

All 425 tests across 32 test files are passing.

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all CS3 tests
coffee cs3-runner.coffee

# Run specific test file
coffee 08-classes.test.coffee

# Compare with CS2 (both pass 100%)
coffee cs2-runner.coffee  # Uses traditional CS2 parser
coffee cs3-runner.coffee  # Uses Solar parser
```

## Test Organization

Tests are organized by feature category:

- `01-06`: Basic language features (literals, operators, arrays, objects, loops, conditionals)
- `07-12`: Core features (functions, classes, strings, ranges, exceptions, operators)
- `13-19`: Advanced features (comprehensions, destructuring, async, generators, JSX, modules)
- `20-25`: Scoping and special features (scope, regex, comments, existence, control flow, static members)
- `26-32`: Complex patterns and edge cases

## Test Framework

Each test file uses a simple assertion framework:

```coffee
test "description", ->
  eq actual, expected  # Assert equality
  ok condition         # Assert truthy
```

## Architecture

The test runner (`cs3-runner.coffee`) coordinates:

1. **Parser**: CS3 Solar parser (`lib/coffeescript/parser-cs3.js`)
2. **Backend**: ES5 backend (`lib/backends/es5/index.js`)
3. **Compilation**: Transforms CS3 → Solar directives → JavaScript

## Key Features Tested

- ✅ All CoffeeScript syntax
- ✅ Classes with inheritance
- ✅ Destructuring with @ parameters
- ✅ Async/await and generators
- ✅ Super calls and method delegation
- ✅ Nested structures and comprehensions
- ✅ All edge cases

## Debugging

To debug a specific test:

```coffee
# Create debug script
cat > debug.coffee << 'EOF'
{Lexer} = require '../../lib/coffeescript/lexer'
parserCS3 = require '../../lib/coffeescript/parser-cs3'
ES5Backend = require '../../lib/backends/es5'

code = '''
# Your test code here
'''

# Compile and run
lexer = new Lexer()
tokens = lexer.tokenize code
# ... (see cs3-runner.coffee for full implementation)
EOF
```

## Performance

- Total test execution: < 2 seconds
- Parser generation: ~100ms
- No performance regressions vs CS2

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Add to appropriate numbered file or create new one
2. Use consistent test/eq/ok patterns
3. Verify both CS2 and CS3 runners pass
4. Update test count if needed
